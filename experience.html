        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>From June 2019 to December 2019 I attended the UNH Coding Bootcamp in Portsmouth, NH.  This was a very intense 6 month program that touched on every aspect of Web Development. At the end of the program I knew I wanted to focus on Front End Web Development and signed up for the TechDegree Program with TreeHouse to zone in on developing my skills even further.</p>

        <h2>Internships</h2>
        <p>I was fortunate enough to find 2 local companies for internships.  The first internship I did was with a company called Addaptation. I was there for 2 months and worked with a platform built by developers at the company.</p>
        <p>The second internship was at a company called INHOUSE Digital. For 3 months I was able to gain experience with WordPress and basic html/css.</p>
